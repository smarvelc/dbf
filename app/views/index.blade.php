<p>    Sometimes testing a website can be frustrating. Once you build your framework you need
some text and some users to fill it with data and content. However, making up filler content and filler users
can be annoying. The Web Developer's Best Friend seeks to aid in this noble struggle by allowing it's users
to request chunks of fake data. Visit our text generator to grab yourself some free paragraphs of random text, 
brought to you by badcow/lorem ipsum. And don't forget to stop by our random user generator to get some users for your site,
brought to you by fzaninotto/faker
