P3 Developer's Best Friend

Live URL: 

The Developer's Best friend is my title for Project 3. I recently started a new job and my life has become crazy because of it. As a result this project is not as polished as I would like it to be, but it still does the job of allowing users to create a number of paragraphs of filler text (anywhere between 1 and 5), and a number of fake users (anywhere between 1 and 10). A page similar to this could be useful for web developers looking to generate filler content and users to test in their sites.

Note: Again, very sorry for the delay and appearance of this project. Balancing my new job and this class has been tough for me. I'm learning a ton from dwa, and hope to continue to do so.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
